Description of basic workflow for RNA-Seq analysis. The tools include practice working with basic R data types and packages including:
- data.table
- ggplot
- deseq2
- clusterProfiler
- and many other tools useful for differential gene and pathway analysis. 

Current markdowns include:
1. Simple DGE analysis using TPM output of Stringtie
      - Includes volcano plot preparation

3. DGE using DESeq2 and raw count data from Stringtie analysis
