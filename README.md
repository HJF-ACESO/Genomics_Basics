### Summary:
A simple workshop to introduce basic tools used in RNA-Sequencing to computational biology beginners using R computational and statistical framework.
The provided materials describes analysis of TPM (transripts per million) or count values in order to identify differentially expressed genes (DGE Analysis).
Identified genes are then used to identify important differentially regulated pathways (GSEA Analysis). 
The materials highlights different ways of analysing data - using prebuilt packages or custom scripts.   


Example of publically available R packages employed in the analyses. 
- data.table [->this](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html)
- ggplot2 [->this](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html)
- deseq2 [->this](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html)
- clusterProfiler [->this](https://yulab-smu.top/biomedical-knowledge-mining-book/index.html)
- table1 [->this](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/table1/vignettes/table1-examples.html)
- and many others ...

### Content:
Current markdowns includes four main sections:

> PART1
- Loadding data, preparation and running of DESeq2

> PART2
- Plotting DESeeq2 results and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

> PART3
- Exploring different results plots

> PART4
- Statistical comparisons and Table1
